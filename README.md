# hello-world.
my first repository

My name is Kyle Rodgers and this is my first step in learning the basics of data science to become a data scientist!
I am 5"9' 170lbs, veteran and ex police officer and firefighter with a brief history of working in IT Support for Dell Technologies.
I hope I can commit to this new adventurous goal i have decided for myself. Time will tell what the future holds past todays date of 5/30/2020, the day Space X launched its first man carried shuttle to space. I hope to one day work for them, Nuralink, or even Tesla.
